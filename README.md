# CodeLume Theme

This is the [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) theme for the codelume-web at `codelume.cn`.

Please note this theme is solely dedicated for `codelume.cn` and isn't meant to be used as a content-neutral theme. It does **not** follow semver and may contain hard-coded logic specific to the codelume-web.

## Development Setup

This repo can be developed on its own since it is a self-contained VitePress theme. Make sure to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager when installing deps. A demo app is available in `/demo` and can be run with `pnpm dev`:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
